# NixDots2.0

This flake is a big combination of various tutorial flakes. Namely:
https://saylesss88.github.io/installation/index.html
https://code.m3ta.dev/m3tam3re/nixcfg

dots-inspiration:
https://github.com/Ly-sec/nixos

The aim is to make a desktop environment that's universally compatible, 
expandable, and sharable to friends and family so that everyone can enjoy
my creation! The more people on linux, the better, and nixos is a great 
way to make it so that the setup is as stable as a rock.

Some features that I'd like to add:
 - encryption and secure secrets (!!!)
 - modular packages for the most common tools
 - I want bells and whistles and every feature of a desktop working as it
should
